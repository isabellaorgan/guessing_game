	<!--A bit of backstory on me, how this game came about-->
  	<article><h2>Over the years, I've collected quite a few records.</h2>
  	<nav><p> I've got a whole collection from the 80's, featuring everything from punk bands like <a href="http://www.deadkennedys.com/">Dead Kennedys</a> to the New Wave stylings of <a href="http://www.yazooinfo.com/">Yaz.</a>
  		<br>
  		I've also got a ton of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz">Jazz</a>.</nav>
  		<br>
  		<b>Aaaaand classic rock.</b>

  		<main><h3> Game Instructions</h3>
  		<!--Instructions for how the game works-->
  		<p>In this game, you will guess how many records I currently own. 
  		<br>
  		<strong>There is only one correct answer.</strong>
  		<br>
  		<i>You will have 5 opportunities to guess correctly.</i>
  		</p>
  		<br>
  		<!--We can make a list of the guesses here, I think-->
  		<h2>Just for fun, let's put your guesses here:</hs>
  		<p> <ul>Guess 1</ul>
  			<ul>Guess 1</ul>
  			<ul>Guess 1</ul>
  			<ul>Guess 1</ul>
  			<ul>Guess 1</ul>
  		</p>
  		<br>
  		<!--Maybe even show how many tries it took-->
  		<p><h3>Did you get it? How many tries did it take?</h3></main>
  		<!--Added an email form for funsies-->
