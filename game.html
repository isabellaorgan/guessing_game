        <h3> Game Instructions</h3>
      <!--Instructions for how the game works-->
      <p>In this game, you will guess how many records I currently own. 
      <br>
      <strong>There is only one correct answer.</strong>
      <br>
      <i>You will have 5 opportunities to guess correctly.</i>
      </p>
      <br>
      <!--We can make a list of the guesses here, I think-->
      <h2>Just for fun, let's put your guesses here:</hs>
      <p> 
        <ul>Guesses</ul>
         <li>Guess 1</li>
         <li>Guess 2</li>
         <li>Guess 3</li>
         <li>Guess 4</li>
