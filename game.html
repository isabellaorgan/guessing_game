  	<h1>How Many Records do I own?</h1>

  	<h2>Over the years, I've collected quite a few records.</h2>
  	<p> I've got a whole collection from the 80's, featuring everything from punk bands like <a href="http://">TSOL</a> to the dulcet tones of <a href="http://">The Smiths.</a>
  		I've also got a ton of <a href="http://">Jazz</a>
  		and classic rock. <img src=" ">
