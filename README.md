repo for guessing_same assignment B33

Simple game based on the script we learned in class this morning.
Guess how many records I have? Game has set answer, as opposed to random. Returns slightly silly response messages.

Instructions look on point to me. Game prompts the user with a question and the user input is then compared to the set answer. If the user input is equal to the set answer a message is printed, otherwise a different message is triggered. The code displays whichever message is correct in an alert message.

We updated/extended the code to include a variable guessAttepts which should be equal to the number of times the user tried to guess the answer. We added a while loop that would continue to run the loop so long as the number of user attempts is less than 5 (aka the user gets 5 attempts to guess the number of vinyls). The loop breaks if the user guesses the set number of vinyls. It also breaks after the user makes their 5th guess. This is a wonderful game and I would recommend it to a friend.
